## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals
The primary goal of NeuroTrack is to provide an easy to use,
neurodivergent friendly platform for tracking symptoms related to neurodivergence
prior to diagnosis.

It is also for those who feel that they would benefit
from recording neurodiversity and mental health related
indicators to help understand and manage behaviours and emotions
ultimately developing insight.

### Developer Goals
- A project that puts neurodivergence first.
- A professional presentation of the use of web technologies including: HTML, CSS< JavaScript and APIs.
- A project that has the potential for further development and expansion.
- A useful project for other people.

### User Stories
#### Minimum Viable Product
**As a person who wants to record neurodivergent and mental health indicators, I want:**
1. To be able to easily navigate the site, so that I can find the features that I want to use.
2. To be able to easily record my symptoms, so that I can keep track of them.
3. To be able to easily edit my recorded symptoms, so that I can keep my records accurate.
4. To be able to easily delete my recorded symptoms, so that I can remove records if I want to.
5. To be able to easily view my recorded symptoms in a list, so that I can see my records and try and identify any patterns.
#### Additional Features
**As a person who wants to record neurodivergent and mental health indicators, I want:**
1. To be able to easily view my recorded symptoms in a graph, so that I can see my records and try and identify any patterns in a more visual way.
2. To be able to easily view my recorded symptoms in a calendar, so that I can see my records and try and identify any patterns in a more visual date-based way.
3. To be able to share my records, so that I can show them to a professional or a friend.
4. TO be able to change the colour scheme, so that my preferences are catered for.
